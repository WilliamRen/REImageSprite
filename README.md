## Requirements
* Xcode 4.5 or higher
* Apple LLVM compiler
* iOS 5.0 or higher
* ARC

## Demo

Build and run the `REImageSpriteExample` project in Xcode to see `REImageSprite` in action.

## Installation

### via CocoaPods

The recommended approach for installating REImageSprite is via the [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) package manager, as it provides flexible dependency management and dead simple installation.

Install CocoaPods if not already available:

``` bash
$ [sudo] gem install cocoapods
$ pod setup
```

Edit your Podfile and add REImageSprite:

``` bash
$ edit Podfile
platform :ios, '5.0'
pod 'REImageSprite', '~> 1.0'
```

Install into your Xcode project:

``` bash
$ pod install
```

### Simple Install

All you need to do is drop `REImageSprite` files into your project, and add `#include "UIImage+REImageSprite.h"` to the top of classes that will use it.

## Example Usage

REImageSprite is a simple `UIImage` category, there's only one task where you specify resource name and sprite (which is essentially a `plist` file and a corresponding image name):

``` objective-c
+ (UIImage *)imageNamed:(NSString *)name fromSprite:(NSString *)sprite
```

Real life example:

``` objective-c
UIButton *button = [[UIButton alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(30, 100, 50, 50)];
[button setImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"YouTube" fromSprite:@"Icons"] forState:UIControlStateNormal];
[button setImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"YouTube_Highlighted" fromSprite:@"Icons"] forState:UIControlStateHighlighted];
[self.view addSubview:button];
```
